        <title>Why I love the Olympic Games</title>
        <body>
        <p>Olympic games arrive every 4 years with one in the summer and one in the winter.
        This is the world stage for elite athletes from all around the world to compete against each other in their respective sport.
        It's a chance to represent their country, become a first or 4th time Olympian, gain experience, and respect for each other.
        The competitiveness and the chance of Olympic medals is what drives these athletes to train hours upon hours for the chance
        to qualify for the Olympic team. And, that takes serious dedication, determination, sacrafices, and hard work.

        <p> One of the pleasures of watching these Olympic games besides the competition is the Opening and Closing Ceremony.
        I love seeing people in costumes dancing or portraying a character in a story, historical timeline of their country, people singing
        in their language, the spectacular fireworks, and the flag bearers of each country. It's just a spectacular event to watch and I can't wait
        to watch the upcoming Winter Olympics in 2018.

        <h2>WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES</h2>

        <h3> FIGURE SKATING </h3>

                                <img src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSmRNGfF18V0RsnUj0STNjgLJgg5jl79KNU7dVNBQ3vfV7PcTCA" />

        <p>Figure skating is the first Olympic sport that I watched while growing up. Although one might always think that it's been a Winter
        Olympic sport from the very beginning, it is however not true. Surprisingly, it started in the Summer Olympics in 1908 and
        1920. It didn't become part of the Winter Olympics until 1924. Figure skating consists of the men's singles, ladies' singles, pairs, and
        ice dancing. Ladies' singles is what I always grew up watching, but it wasn't until I got older that I enjoyed watching the men's singles and ice dancing.
        I think what captivated me to watch the men's singles was the chance of seeing someone complete a quad jump on ice. It's basically four complete rotations in
        the air, and that extra rotation in the air makes it even harder to complete. A typical jump for men's and ladies' singles is a jump that only consists of three
        rotations. The quad jumps was ground breaking and really changed the competition of the men's singles skating. As for ice dancing, I didn't really pay attention
        to it until the Sochi Olympics. I realized that it looks harder than the ladies' singles because you're skating with a partner and every move and step
        have to be in sync with each other. That's so important in ice dancing and when you skate with a partner you have to trust them with their lifts and timing.
        In the end, I will never get tired of watching figure skating as I have grown to love it even more. But, my ice skating skills will only take me as far as the
        ice skating rink and hopefully, without falling.</p>

    <p> <h4> SNOWBOARDING</h4> </p>

                              <img src="http://snowboardingprofiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/best-freestyle-snowboard-for-the-pipe.jpg" />

        <p>Snowboarding is a much newer Olympic sport compared to figure skating. It wasn't added to the Winter Olympics until 1998 in Nagano, Japan. I find snowboarding to
        be such an adrenaline rush to watch because of the speed and the height these snowboarders can get when they do their jumps off the pipe. The biggest name in snowboarding is
        Shaun White and he's the reason why I started paying attention to snowboarding. Although I don't watch snowboarding consistenly enough compared to figure skating, I still watch
        it whenever I get the chance. I love seeing the snowboarders perform these massive tricks on the pipe. I don't have to much to say about snowboarding, but it would be really
        cool if Shaun White competes in the Summer and Winter Olympics because not only is that rare, but the first person to do so. If he joins the Summer Olympics he would be
        competing in the skatboarding competitions. </p>
